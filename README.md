Use the following command to run the script easily in one run:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steven66619/archsubvolumesetup/master/subvol.sh && sudo chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

i use a arch installer with a desktop  not that i need it but i thought this script would make my life easier
